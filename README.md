# Auto-Blog-Generator-via-OpenAI
This project takes a topic as an input argument and then creates a blog post via OpenAI Api. Then commits on Github repo doruktarhan.io.

The project works with OpenAI and Github API's so in order to work with the project, you need to get API keys for both.

Also, I have previously created a Repo as doruktarhan.github.io which has an index.html file where I keep my blog posts.

The project does the following step-by-step:
- Takes a topic as an input argument.
- Creates a blog post about the topic.
- Changes the format of the post to html via BeautifulSoup.
- Updates the index.html file in doruktarhan.github.io Repo.
- Uploads relevant files.
- Commit changes via GitHub API and updates the blog. 

You can contact me for further questions.
